# Systems Index — Crazy Stuff

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-03-22
**Total Systems:** 34
**Designed:** 0 / 34

> This index is the authoritative decomposition of the game into individual systems.
> Each system should have its own GDD at `design/gdd/[system-slug].md`.
> The monolithic GDD at `design/gdd/crazy-stuff-gdd.md` remains the source of

## High-Risk Bottlenecks

These systems have the most dependents — mistakes here cascade widely:

| System | Dependents | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Isometric Tile Renderer | 8 systems | CRITICAL — validate tile size (32×16px) in prototype before locking |
| Authentication / Account | 7 systems | CRITICAL — session model affects all persistence |
| Race Room (Colyseus) | 7 systems | CRITICAL — authoritative state schema drives all race systems |
| Item / Inventory | 6 systems | HIGH — schema must handle all 12 avatar slots + furniture + pickups |

## Recommended Design Order

Design GDDs in this order (dependency-safe + phase-priority ordered).
Note: the monolithic GDD covers most systems at a high level — per-system GDDs
add formulas, edge cases, and acceptance criteria needed before implementation.

```
 1. Isometric Tile Renderer      Phase 0  ← Foundation, most-depended-on
 2. Race Room (Colyseus)         Phase 1  ← Foundation, defines server state schema
 3. Item / Inventory             Phase 2  ← Core bottleneck for 6 systems
 4. Authentication / Account     Phase 0  ← Core bottleneck for 7 systems
 5. Player Movement              Phase 0
 6. Terrain System               Phase 1
 7. Respawn System               Phase 1
 8. Button / Trap System         Phase 1
 9. Pickup System                Phase 1
10. Scoring System               Phase 1
11. Matchmaking / Queue          Phase 1
12. Race UI                      Phase 1
13. Currency                     Phase 2
14. XP / Level System            Phase 2
15. Avatar Renderer              Phase 2
16. Avatar / Customization       Phase 2
17. Seasonal Leaderboard         Phase 2
18. Lobby / Crazy Town           Phase 3
19. Chat System                  Phase 3
20. Friends / Social Graph       Phase 3
21. Emote System                 Phase 3
22. Voice Chat                   Phase 3
23. Ambient / NPC System         Phase 3
24. Lobby UI                     Phase 3
25. Gacha System                 Phase 4
26. Store System                 Phase 4
27. Payment Integration          Phase 4
28. Economy UI                   Phase 4
29. Housing System               Phase 4
30. Furniture / Decoration       Phase 4
31. Guestbook                    Phase 4
